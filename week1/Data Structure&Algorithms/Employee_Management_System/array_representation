Arrays in Memory:

Arrays are a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
The address of the first element is used to access the entire array. Each element's address can be calculated using the base address and the index of the element.

Advantages:

Constant Time Access: Arrays provide O(1) time complexity for accessing elements by index.
Memory Efficiency: Since elements are stored in contiguous locations, there is no overhead for additional pointers or references.
Cache Friendliness: Contiguous memory allocation can improve cache performance due to spatial locality.
