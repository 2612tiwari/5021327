Analysis:
Time Complexity:

Add: O(1) if there is space in the array. If the array is full, adding requires resizing, which is not covered in this implementation.
Search: O(n) because you may need to iterate through the entire array to find the employee.
Traverse: O(n) as you need to visit each element in the array.
Delete: O(n) due to the need to shift elements to fill the gap left by the deleted employee.

Limitations of Arrays:

Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size once created. If you need to accommodate more employees than initially allocated, you'll need to resize, which is not handled in the simple array implementation.
Inefficient Insertions and Deletions: Inserting or deleting elements (other than at the end) requires shifting elements, which can be inefficient.
Wasted Space: If the number of employees is less than the array's capacity, the unused space is wasted.

When to Use Arrays:

Arrays are suitable when the number of elements is known in advance and doesn't change frequently.
For simple scenarios where fixed-size collections are acceptable and performance considerations like constant-time access are crucial, arrays can be an efficient choice.
For dynamic scenarios or where frequent insertions/deletions are required, consider using other data structures like ArrayList in Java, which provides dynamic resizing and better management for such cases.
