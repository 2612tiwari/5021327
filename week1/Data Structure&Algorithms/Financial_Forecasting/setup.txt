Create a Method to Calculate Future Value Using Recursion:

The future value 
𝐹
𝑉
FV of an investment can be calculated using a simple recursive formula:
𝐹
𝑉
=
𝑃
𝑉
×
(
1
+
𝑟
)
𝑛
FV=PV×(1+r) 
n
 
Where:

𝑃
𝑉
PV = Present Value
𝑟
r = Growth Rate (as a decimal)
𝑛
n = Number of Periods
In a recursive approach, you might break down the problem as follows:

Base Case: When 
𝑛
n is 0, the future value is the present value.
Recursive Case: Compute the future value for 
𝑛
−
1
n−1 periods and apply the growth rate to get the future value for 
𝑛
n periods.
